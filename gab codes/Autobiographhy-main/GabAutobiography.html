        <p data-aos="fade-up">
          Music, programming, photography, videography, and sports are some of
          my favorite things. <br />
          I spend most of my leisure time making music and practicing B-roll
          shots. My first instrument<br />
          was the guitar, which I learned when I was six years old. I practiced
          every day until my small <br />
          fingers were able to grasp the tough chords. I composed my first piece
          of music when I learned the basic<br />
          chord progression, and it is about my love for God. To be honest, I'm
          not a particularly good singer,<br />
          but I enjoy singing. I led our church's praise and worship and played
          the piano whenever it was my turn.<br />
          I also sang in the youth and singles choirs, as well as participating
          in many church-sponsored activities.<br />
          Recently, I've been working on a song that will hopefully be released
          next year.

          I have no idea what the future holds, but I pray that with the grace
          of God, I will still be happy<br />
          with my family when I become thirty. I imagined myself being
          successful and having a long<br />
          and fruitful life with my friends. Despite the fact that I am certain
          that I will face hardships and<br />
          difficulties, I am confident that my God will never abandon me. I hope
          that by the time I'm thirty, <br />
          I'll be running my own company and traveling around the world with my
          friends and family. I know <br />
          that seems foolish, but I truly want this to happen. Whatever plan God
          has in mind for me, I hope <br />
          and pray that I will not be deterred from following it because I know
          it is the greatest!
