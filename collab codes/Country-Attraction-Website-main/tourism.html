              The Great Pyramid of Giza (also known as the Pyramid of Khufu or
              the Pyramid of Cheops) is the oldest and largest of the Giza
              pyramid complex, which borders modern-day Giza in Egypt. It is the
              oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, as well as the
              only one that has been preserved in its entirety. The Great
              Pyramid was constructed by quarrying 2.3 million massive pieces
              weighing a total of 6 million tonnes. The majority of the stones
              aren't uniform in size or shape, and they're just lightly treated.

              Abu Simbel is an ancient temple complex in southern Egypt, built
              into a solid rock cliff and situated near the Nile River's second
              cataract. The two temples that make up the site were built either
              between 1264 and 1244 BCE or 1244-1224 BCE under the reign of
              Ramesses II (c. 1279 - c. 1213 BCE). The Great Temple is 98 feet
              (30 meters) tall and 115 feet (35 meters) long, with four sitting
              colossi flanking the entrance, two on each side, each 65 feet (20
              meters) tall, showing Ramesses II on his throne.

            <p data-aos="fade-up">
              Until it empties into the Mediterranean Sea, the Nile River
              travels for 6,600 kilometers (4,100 miles). The river has offered
              a supply of irrigation for thousands of years, transforming the
              parched plains surrounding it into lush agricultural land. The
              river is still used as a source of irrigation as well as a major
              transit and trading route today.

            <p data-aos="fade-up">
              In English, Saccara/Saqqara is an Egyptian hamlet in the Giza
              Governorate notable for its huge, ancient burial site of Egyptian
              pharaohs (kings) and royals, which serves as the necropolis for
              Memphis, the ancient Egyptian metropolis. There are many pyramids
              at Saqqara, including the world-famous Step pyramid of Djoser,
              also known as the Step Tomb, and a number of mastaba tombs.
              Saqqara is around 7 by 1.5 km in size and is located 30 kilometers
              (19 miles) south of modern-day Cairo (4.3 by 0.9 mi).

            <p data-aos="fade-up">
              Siwa Oasis is located 350 miles (560 kilometers) west-southwest of
              Cairo, near the Libyan border. The oasis is 6 miles (10
              kilometers) long and 4–5 miles (6–8 kilometers) broad, with 200
              springs. The historic walled villages of Siwa and Aghrm, which are
              true fortresses, are located on two rock outcrops. The oasis was
              the location of the oracle temple of Amon (Zeus Ammon), which was
              already famous in the time of Herodotus and was consulted by
              Alexander the Great. Siwa's ancient Egyptian name was Sekht-am,
              which meant "palm country."
