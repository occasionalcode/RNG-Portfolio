        <p>
          I am a young college boy who majors in Computer Science in Malayan
          Colleges Mindanao. I delight in listening to and making music, gaming,
          philosophy, sports and coding. One of my interests in programming is
          web developing. Though I'm still inexperienced, I plan to work in this
          field in the long term. I also have a passion for game development
          given that I'm a gamer, however I do not see myself developing games
          for a living. In terms of my music-making hobby, I mostly listen to
          and produce hip-hop songs. Some of my major influences are Playboi
          Carti, Lil Uzi Vert, Travis Scott, and Lil Mosey. I am also still in
          the process of branching out to other genres so that I will be a
          versatile artist. <br /><br />
          For my religious beliefs, I am a practicing Christian who gets my core
          beliefs from the bible. I am interested in Christian apologetics
          because someday I want to be eloquent in defending my faith through
          logic, reason, science, and philosophy. 19 years in this world has
          taught me a lot and made me interested in a lot of things, I am
          excited and I'm looking forward to see what else life has in store for
          me.

        <p>
          I once dreamt to be a lot of things. I dreamt to be a doctor, to be an
          NBA player, to be a military officer, to be in the tech industry, and
          to be a businessman. Sometimes I get confused about what I really
          want, but I am reminded to take it slow and live one day at a time. I
          always wonder what the future has in store for me, I also wonder about
          the past regarding how things came to be from the beginning of time.
          Being a thinker or an *overthinker* led me to process occurrences that
          people do not normally think about, maybe it's why I like to play with
          my mind often. These thought experiments often lead me to extreme
          ideas which, I think, are the roots of my inconsistent but extreme
          competitiveness and ambitiousness.
          <br /><br />
          "Dreamer, wonderer, competitor" these are the words I would like to
          describe the future me. The future "Riki Tiu" that I'm currently
          striving for day by day by day. I might have setbacks but I'd like to
          think I'd always comeback, and by the age of 30, I want to embody
          these three words so that no matter what my final dream would be, I
          know I will dream big, think big, and win big.
